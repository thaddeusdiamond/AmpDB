how long to wait
how many txn in one batch (hard limit)
# of cores in each DB slice
# of parallel preproc nodes
# of replicated preproc nodes

Preproc input: clintID, txntypeID, args, readset, writeset, duration
               ducation += network latency

Scheduler input: Jobs{ Duration, NodeList }
                 ConflictGraph
Scheduler output: Schedule with minimal finishing time w.r.t. conflict graph

Preproc output: 1. msg to slices (idealy only those involves)
                2. msg to replica
                3. write to storage (or replica may be the storage)
                4. wait for storage to return
                5. msg to slices: good to go
